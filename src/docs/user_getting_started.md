# Using "Theia" as an End User

This section is about using Theia-based applications from an end user point of view. Please note that Eclipse Theia is a platform to build tools and IDEs. As an end user, you are not using “Theia”, but always a product based on Theia. Therefore, please consider the specific end user documentation of the product you are using over this section.

However, as Theia as a platform provides many generic features that might be a direct part of the Theia-based product you use, e.g the Extensions View. Therefore we still provide some selected documentation about common use cases. This documentation is based on Theia Blueprint, which is a standard template product based on Theia provided by the Theia project. This might slightly differ from the Theia-based product you are using, please contact the provider of your tool if there are uncertainties.
